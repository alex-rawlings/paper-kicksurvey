	abstract = {Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) and the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC) are methods for estimating pointwise out-of-sample prediction accuracy from a fitted Bayesian model using the log-likelihood evaluated at the posterior simulations of the parameter values. LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

We introduce a practical and computationally efficient sensitivity analysis approach using importance sampling to estimate properties of posteriors resulting from power-scaling the prior or likelihood. On this basis, we suggest a diagnostic that can indicate the presence of prior-data conflict or likelihood noninformativity and discuss limitations to this power-scaling approach. The approach can be easily included in Bayesian workflows with minimal effort by the model builder and we present an implementation in our new R package priorsense. We further demonstrate the workflow on case studies of real data using models varying in complexity from simple linear models to Gaussian process models.},

These sources have the potential to tell us much about astrophysics, but are also of unique importance for testing aspects of the general theory of relativity in the strong field regime. Here we discuss these sources from the perspectives of astrophysics, data analysis and applications to testing general relativity, providing both a description of the current state of knowledge and an outline of some of the outstanding questions that still need to be addressed.

	abstract = {We have searched for continuous gravitational wave (CGW) signals produced by individually resolvable, circular supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in the latest European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) data set, which consists of ultraprecise timing data on 41-ms pulsars. We develop frequentist and Bayesian detection algorithms to search both for monochromatic and frequency-evolving systems. None of the adopted algorithms show evidence for the presence of such a CGW signal, indicating that the data are best described by pulsar and radiometer noise only. Depending on the adopted detection algorithm, the 95 per cent upper limit on the sky-averaged strain amplitude lies in the range 6 \texttimes{} 10-15 {$<$} A {$<$} 1.5 \texttimes{} 10-14 at 5 nHz {$<$} f {$<$} 7 nHz. This limit varies by a factor of five, depending on the assumed source position and the most constraining limit is achieved towards the positions of the most sensitive pulsars in the timing array. The most robust upper limit - obtained via a full Bayesian analysis searching simultaneously over the signal and pulsar noise on the subset of ours six best pulsars - is A {$\approx$} 10-14. These limits, the most stringent to date at f {$<$} 10 nHz, exclude the presence of sub-centiparsec binaries with chirp mass M\_c{$>$}10\^9 M\_\{{$\odot\rbrace$} out to a distance of about 25 Mpc, and with M\_c{$>$}10\^\{10\} M\_\{{$\odot\rbrace$} out to a distance of about 1Gpc (z {$\approx$} 0.2). We show that state-of-the-art SMBHB population models predict {$<$}1 per cent probability of detecting a CGW with the current EPTA data set, consistent with the reported non-detection. We stress, however, that PTA limits on individual CGW have improved by almost an order of magnitude in the last five years. The continuing advances in pulsar timing data acquisition and analysis techniques will allow for strong astrophysical constraints on the population of nearby SMBHBs in the coming years.\vphantom{\}\}}},

	abstract = {Isophotal analysis of M87, using data from the Advanced Camera for Surveys, reveals a projected displacement of 6.8 {$\pm$} 0.8 pc (\textasciitilde 0farcs1) between the nuclear point source (presumed to be the location of the supermassive black hole, SMBH) and the photo-center of the galaxy. The displacement is along a position angle of 307\textdegree{} {$\pm$} 17\textdegree{} and is consistent with the jet axis. This suggests the active SMBH in M87 does not currently reside at the galaxy center of mass, but is displaced in the counter-jet direction. Possible explanations for the displacement include orbital motion of an SMBH binary, gravitational perturbations due to massive objects (e.g., globular clusters), acceleration by an asymmetric or intrinsically one-sided jet, and gravitational recoil resulting from the coalescence of an SMBH binary. The displacement direction favors the latter two mechanisms. However, jet asymmetry is only viable, at the observed accretion rate, for a jet age of {$>$}0.1 Gyr and if the galaxy restoring force is negligible. This could be the case in the low-density core of M87. A moderate recoil \textasciitilde 1 Myr ago might explain the disturbed nature of the nuclear gas disk, could be aligned with the jet axis, and can produce the observed offset. Alternatively, the displacement could be due to residual oscillations resulting from a large recoil that occurred in the aftermath of a major merger {$<$}=1 Gyr ago. Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.},

Unfortunately, that understanding is confined within the mathematics of differential geometry which has limited its dissemination, especially to the applied communities for which it is particularly important. In this review I provide a comprehensive conceptual account of these theoretical foundations, focusing on developing a principled intuition behind the method and its optimal implementations rather of any exhaustive rigor. Whether a practitioner or a statistician, the dedicated reader will acquire a solid grasp of how Hamiltonian Monte Carlo works, when it succeeds, and, perhaps most importantly, when it fails.},

In this study, we search for continuous waves: gravitational wave signals produced by individual supermassive black hole binaries in the local universe. We consider binaries on circular orbits and neglect the evolution of orbital frequency over the observational span. We find no evidence for such signals and set sky averaged 95 per cent upper limits on their amplitude h95. The most sensitive frequency is 10 nHz with h95 = 9.1 \texttimes{} 10-15. We achieved the best upper limit to date at low and high frequencies of the PTA band thanks to improved effective cadence of observations. In our analysis, we have taken into account the recently discovered common red noise process, which has an impact at low frequencies. We also find that the peculiar noise features present in some pulsars data must be taken into account to reduce the false alarm. We show that using custom noise models is essential in searching for continuous gravitational wave signals and setting the upper limit.},

@article{gualandris2017,
	abstract = {Coalescing massive black hole binaries, formed during galaxy mergers, are expected to be a primary source of low-frequency gravitational waves. Yet in isolated gas-free spherical stellar systems, the hardening of the binary stalls at parsec-scale separations owing to the inefficiency of relaxation-driven loss-cone refilling. Repopulation via collisionless orbit diffusion in triaxial systems is more efficient, but published simulation results are contradictory. While sustained hardening has been reported in simulations of galaxy mergers with N {$\sim$} 106 stars and in early simulations of rotating models, in isolated non-rotating triaxial models the hardening rate continues to fall with increasing N, a signature of spurious two-body relaxation. We present a novel approach for studying loss-cone repopulation in galactic nuclei. Since loss-cone repopulation in triaxial systems owes to orbit diffusion, it is a purely collisionless phenomenon and can be studied with an approximated force calculation technique, provided the force errors are well behaved and sufficiently small. We achieve this using an accurate fast multipole method and define a proxy for the hardening rate that depends only on stellar angular momenta. We find that the loss cone is efficiently replenished even in very mildly triaxial models (with axis ratios 1:0.9:0.8). Such triaxiality is unavoidable following galactic mergers and can drive binaries into the gravitational wave regime. We conclude that there is no `final parsec problem'.},

	abstract = {Coalescing supermassive black hole binaries (BHBs) are expected to be the loudest sources of gravitational waves (GWs) in the Universe. Detection rates for ground or space-based detectors based on cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models are highly uncertain. A major difficulty stems from the necessity to model the BHB from the scale of the merger to that of inspiral. Of particular relevance to the GW merger time-scale is the binary eccentricity. Here, we present a self-consistent numerical study of the eccentricity of BHBs formed in massive gas-free mergers from the early stages of the merger to the hardening phase, followed by a semi-analytical model down to coalescence. We find that the early eccentricity of the unbound black hole pair is largely determined by the initial orbit. It systematically decreases during the dynamical friction phase. The eccentricity at binary formation is affected by stochasticity and noise owing to encounters with stars, but preserves a strong correlation with the initial orbital eccentricity. Binding of the black holes is a phase characterized by strong perturbations; and we present a quantitative definition of the time of binary formation. During hardening the eccentricity increases in minor mergers, unless the binary is approximately circular, but remains largely unchanged in major mergers, in agreement with predictions from semi-analytical models based on isotropic scattering experiments. Coalescence times due to hardening and GW emission in gas-poor non-rotating ellipticals are {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.5 Gyr for the large initial eccentricities (0.5 {$\leq$} e {$\leq$} 0.9) typical of galaxy mergers in cosmological simulations.},

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

@article{khan2012,
	abstract = {Galaxy centers are residing places for supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Galaxy mergers bring SMBHs close together to form gravitationally bound binary systems, which, if able to coalesce in less than a Hubble time, would be one of the most promising sources of gravitational waves (GWs) for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. In spherical galaxy models, SMBH binaries stall at a separation of approximately 1 pc, leading to the "final parsec problem" (FPP). On the other hand, it has been shown that merger-induced triaxiality of the remnant in equal-mass mergers is capable of supporting a constant supply of stars on the so-called centrophilic orbits that interact with the binary and thus avoid the FPP. In this paper, using a set of direct N-body simulations of mergers of initially spherically symmetric galaxies with different mass ratios, we show that the merger-induced triaxiality is also able to drive unequal-mass SMBH binaries to coalescence. The binary hardening rates are high and depend only weakly on the mass ratios of SMBHs for a wide range of mass ratios q. There is, however, an abrupt transition in the hardening rates for mergers with mass ratios somewhere between q \textasciitilde{} 0.05 and 0.1, resulting from the monotonic decrease of merger-induced triaxiality with mass ratio q, as the secondary galaxy becomes too small and light to significantly perturb the primary, i.e., the more massive one. The hardening rates are significantly higher for galaxies having steep cusps in comparison with those having shallow cups at centers. The evolution of the binary SMBH leads to relatively shallower inner slopes at the centers of the merger remnants. The stellar mass displaced by the SMBH binary on its way to coalescence is \textasciitilde 1-5 times the combined mass of binary SMBHs. The coalescence timescales for SMBH binary with mass \textasciitilde 106 M {$\odot$} are less than 1 Gyr and for those at the upper end of SMBH masses 109 M {$\odot$} are 1-2 Gyr for less eccentric binaries whereas they are less than 1 Gyr for highly eccentric binaries. SMBH binaries are thus expected to be promising sources of GWs at low and high redshifts.},

	abstract = {Supermassive black holes (BHs) have been found in 85 galaxies by dynamical modeling of spatially resolved kinematics. The Hubble Space Telescope revolutionized BH research by advancing the subject from its proof-of-concept phase into quantitative studies of BH demographics. Most influential was the discovery of a tight correlation between BH mass [Formula: see text] and the velocity dispersion {$\sigma$} of the bulge component of the host galaxy. Together with similar correlations with bulge luminosity and mass, this led to the widespread belief that BHs and bulges coevolve by regulating each other's growth. Conclusions based on one set of correlations from [Formula: see text] in brightest cluster ellipticals to [Formula: see text] in the smallest galaxies dominated BH work for more than a decade. New results are now replacing this simple story with a richer and more plausible picture in which BHs correlate differently with different galaxy components. A reasonable aim is to use this progress to refine our understanding of BH-galaxy coevolution. BHs with masses of 105-106M{$\odot$} are found in many bulgeless galaxies. Therefore, classical (elliptical-galaxy-like) bulges are not necessary for BH formation. On the other hand, although they live in galaxy disks, BHs do not correlate with galaxy disks. Also, any [Formula: see text] correlations with the properties of disk-grown pseudobulges and dark matter halos are weak enough to imply no close coevolution. The above and other correlations of host-galaxy parameters with each other and with [Formula: see text] suggest that there are four regimes of BH feedback. (1) Local, secular, episodic, and stochastic feeding of small BHs in largely bulgeless galaxies involves too little energy to result in coevolution. (2) Global feeding in major, wet galaxy mergers rapidly grows giant BHs in short-duration, quasar-like events whose energy feedback does affect galaxy evolution. The resulting hosts are classical bulges and coreless-rotating-disky ellipticals. (3) After these AGN phases and at the highest galaxy masses, maintenance-mode BH feedback into X-ray-emitting gas has the primarily negative effect of helping to keep baryons locked up in hot gas and thereby keeping galaxy formation from going to completion. This happens in giant, core-nonrotating-boxy ellipticals. Their properties, including their tight correlations between [Formula: see text] and core parameters, support the conclusion that core ellipticals form by dissipationless major mergers. They inherit coevolution effects from smaller progenitor galaxies. Also, (4) independent of any feedback physics, in BH growth modes 2 and 3, the averaging that results from successive mergers plays a major role in decreasing the scatter in [Formula: see text] correlations from the large values observed in bulgeless and pseudobulge galaxies to the small values observed in giant elliptical galaxies.},

The random impulses exerted on the binary's center of mass by the field stars are greater than those exerted on a point particle due to inelastic scattering. The frictional force acting on the binary is less than that acting on a point particle due to randomization of the trajectories of field stars that pass near the binary. Both effects tend to increase the random motion of a binary compared with that of a point mass. If the maximum effective impact parameter for gravitational encounters is comparable to the radius of gravitational influence of the binary, its Brownian velocity can be increased by a modest factor ({$<\sptilde$}2) compared with that of a single particle. This condition is probably fulfilled in the case of binary supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei.},

The magnitude of the mass deficit is in principle related to the galaxy's merger history, but the relation has never been quantified. Here high-accuracy N-body simulations are used to calibrate this relation. Mass deficits are shown to be Mdef\textasciitilde 0.5M12, with M12 the total mass of the binary; the coefficient in this relation is found to depend only weakly on M2/M1 or on the galaxy's preexisting nuclear density profile. Hence, after N mergers, Mdef\textasciitilde 0.5 NM\textbullet, with M\textbullet{} the final (current) black hole mass. When compared with observed mass deficits, this result implies 1{$<$} N {$<$} 3, in accord with hierarchical structure formation models.

Mergers of spiral galaxies as the only formation mechanism for elliptical galaxies can reproduce neither the kinematic and photometric properties of very massive elliptical galaxies nor the change from rotationally flattened, disky systems to anisotropic, boxy systems with increasing luminosity. We present numerical simulations showing that binary mergers of early-type galaxies open an additional channel for the formation of anisotropic, slowly rotating, boxy elliptical galaxies. Including this channel in a semianalytical model, we can successfully reproduce the observed trend that more luminous giant elliptical galaxies are more boxy and less flattened by rotation. This trend can be more strongly reproduced by suppressing residual gas infall and star formation for galaxies with stellar bulge masses M*{$>$}=3\texttimes 1010 Msolar. Hence we propose that mergers of early-type galaxies play an important role in the assembly of massive elliptical galaxies.},

	abstract = {The coalescence of massive black hole binaries (BHBs) in galactic mergers is the primary source of gravitational waves (GWs) at low frequencies. Current estimates of GW detection rates for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna and the Pulsar Timing Array vary by three orders of magnitude. To understand this variation, we simulate the merger of equal-mass, eccentric, galaxy pairs with central massive black holes and shallow inner density cusps. We model the formation and hardening of a central BHB using the fast multiple method as a force solver, which features a O(N) scaling with the number N of particles and obtains results equivalent to direct-summation simulations. At N {$\sim$} 5 \texttimes{} 105, typical for contemporary studies, the eccentricity of the BHBs can vary significantly for different random realizations of the same initial condition, resulting in a substantial variation of the merger time-scale. This scatter owes to the stochasticity of stellar encounters with the BHB and decreases with increasing N. We estimate that N {$\sim$} 107 within the stellar half-light radius suffices to reduce the scatter in the merger time-scale to {$\sim$}10 per cent. Our results suggest that at least some of the uncertainty in low-frequency GW rates owes to insufficient numerical resolution.},

	abstract = {Supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries represent the main target for missions such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna and Pulsar Timing Arrays. The understanding of their dynamical evolution prior to coalescence is therefore crucial to improving detection strategies and for the astrophysical interpretation of the gravitational wave data. In this paper, we use high-resolution N-body simulations to model the merger of two equal-mass galaxies hosting a central SMBH. In our models, all binaries are initially prograde with respect to the galaxy sense of rotation. But, binaries that form with a high eccentricity, e {$\greaterequivlnt$} 0.7, quickly reverse their sense of rotation and become almost perfectly retrograde at the moment of binary formation. The evolution of these binaries proceeds towards larger eccentricities, as expected for a binary hardening in a counter-rotating stellar distribution. Binaries that form with lower eccentricities remain prograde and at comparatively low eccentricities. We study the origin of the orbital flip by using an analytical model that describes the early stages of binary evolution. This model indicates that the orbital plane flip is due to the torque from the triaxial background mass distribution that naturally arises from the galactic merger process. Our results imply the existence of a population of SMBH binaries with a high eccentricity and could have significant implications for the detection of the gravitational wave signal emitted by these systems.},

	abstract = {Numerical solutions to Newtons equations of motion for chaotic self gravitating systems of more than 2 bodies are often regarded to be irreversible. This is due to the exponential growth of errors introduced by the integration scheme and the numerical round-off in the least significant figure. This secular growth of error is sometimes attributed to the increase in entropy of the system even though Newton's equations of motion are strictly time reversible. We demonstrate that when numerical errors are reduced to below the physical perturbation and its exponential growth during integration the microscopic reversibility is retrieved. Time reversibility itself is not a guarantee for a definitive solution to the chaotic N-body problem. However, time reversible algorithms may be used to find initial conditions for which perturbed trajectories converge rather than diverge. The ability to calculate such a converging pair of solutions is a striking illustration which shows that it is possible to compute a definitive solution to a highly unstable problem. This works as follows: If you (i) use a code which is capable of producing a definitive solution (and which will therefore handle converging pairs of solutions correctly), (ii) use it to study the statistical result of some other problem, and then (iii) find that some other code produces a solution S with statistical properties which are indistinguishable from those of the definitive solution, then solution S may be deemed veracious.},

	abstract = {We study the impact of merging supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on the central regions of massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) using a series of merger simulations with varying mass ratios. The ETG models include realistic stellar and dark matter components and are evolved with the GADGET-3 based regularized tree code KETJU. We show that observed key properties of the nuclear stellar populations of massive ETGs, namely flat stellar density distributions (cores), tangentially biased velocity distributions, and kinematically decoupled (counter-)rotation, can naturally result from a single process\textemdash the scouring by SMBHs. Major mergers with mass ratios of q {$>$} 1/3 produce flat, tangentially biased cores with kinematically distinct components. These kinematic features originate from reversals of the SMBH orbits caused by gravitational torques after pericenter passages. Minor mergers (q {$\lessequivlnt$} 1/3), on the other hand, form non-rotating cores and the orbit reversal becomes less important. Low-density stellar cores scoured in (multiple) minor mergers are less tangentially biased. This implies that the nuclear stellar properties of massive ETGs can be solely explained by stellar dynamical processes during their final assembly without any need for ``feedback'' from accreting black holes. We predict a strong correlation between decoupled cores, central anisotropy, and merger history: decoupled cores form in binary mergers and we predict them to occur in elliptical galaxies with the strongest central anisotropy. Measurements of the central orbital structure are the key to understanding the number of mergers that a given galaxy has experienced.},

The twofold parallelization of the O(N\_part\^2) force loops and the substep divisions of the extrapolation method allow for a parallel scaling up to NCPU = 0.2 \texttimes{} Npart. The efficient parallel scaling of MSTAR makes the accurate integration of much larger particle numbers possible compared to the traditional algorithmic regularization chain (AR-CHAIN) methods, e.g. Npart = 5000 particles on 400 CPUs for 1 Gyr in a few weeks of wall-clock time. We present applications of MSTAR on few particle systems, studying the Kozai mechanism and N-body systems like star clusters with up to Npart = 104 particles. Combined with a tree or fast multipole-based integrator, the high performance of MSTAR removes a major computational bottleneck in simulations with regularized subsystems. It will enable the next-generation galactic-scale simulations with up to 109 stellar particles (e.g. m\_\star = 100 M\_{$\odot$} for an M\_\star = 10\^\{11\} M\_{$\odot$} galaxy), including accurate collisional dynamics in the vicinity of nuclear supermassive black holes.},

@article{springel2021,
	abstract = {Numerical methods have become a powerful tool for research in astrophysics, but their utility depends critically on the availability of suitable simulation codes. This calls for continuous efforts in code development, which is necessitated also by the rapidly evolving technology underlying today's computing hardware. Here, we discuss recent methodological progress in the GADGET code, which has been widely applied in cosmic structure formation over the past two decades. The new version offers improvements in force accuracy, in time-stepping, in adaptivity to a large dynamic range in time-scales, in computational efficiency, and in parallel scalability through a special MPI/shared-memory parallelization and communication strategy, and a more-sophisticated domain decomposition algorithm. A manifestly momentum conserving fast multipole method (FMM) can be employed as an alternative to the one-sided TreePM gravity solver introduced in earlier versions. Two different flavours of smoothed particle hydrodynamics, a classic entropy-conserving formulation and a pressure-based approach, are supported for dealing with gaseous flows. The code is able to cope with very large problem sizes, thus allowing accurate predictions for cosmic structure formation in support of future precision tests of cosmology, and at the same time is well adapted to high dynamic range zoom-calculations with extreme variability of the particle number density in the simulated volume. The GADGET-4 code is publicly released to the community and contains infrastructure for on-the-fly group and substructure finding and tracking, as well as merger tree building, a simple model for radiative cooling and star formation, a high dynamic range power spectrum estimator, and an initial condition generator based on second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory.},

    abstract = "{Parsec-scale separation supermassive black hole binaries in the centre of gas-rich galaxy merger remnants could be surrounded by massive circumbinary discs (CBDs). Black hole mass and spin evolution during the gas-rich binary inspiral are crucial in determining the direction and power of relativistic jets that radio observations with LOFAR and SKAO will probe, and for predicting gravitational wave (GW) emission that IPTA and LISA will measure. We present 3D hydrodynamic simulations capturing gas-rich, self-gravitating CBDs around a 2 × 106 M⊙ supermassive black hole binary, that probe different mass ratios, eccentricities and inclinations. We employ a sub-grid Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disc to self-consistently model black hole mass and spin evolution together with super-Lagrangian refinement techniques to resolve gas flows, streams and mini-discs within the cavity, which play a fundamental role in torquing and feeding the binary. We find that higher mass ratio and eccentric binaries result in larger cavities, while retrograde binaries result in smaller cavities. All of the simulated binaries are expected to shrink with net gravitational torques being negative. Unlike previous simulations, we do not find preferential accretion onto the secondary black hole. This implies smaller chirp masses at coalescence and hence a weaker GW background. Critically this means that spin-alignment is faster than the binary inspiral timescale even for low mass ratios. When considering initially misaligned systems, the orientation of the mini-discs around each black hole can vary significantly. We discuss the implications of this behaviour for black hole spin alignment and highlight the need for broader parameter space studies of misaligned systems to understand the impact on black hole recoil velocities.}",

We focus on the choices involved in setting up these measures, and we compare them in three simple examples, one theoretical and two applied. The contribution of this paper is to put all these information criteria into a Bayesian predictive context and to better understand, through small examples, how these methods can apply in practice.},
